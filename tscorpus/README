The Treebank Semantics Corpus contains treebank annotation for English
and Japanese texts following a scheme adapted from the Annotation manual
for the Penn Historical Corpora and the PCEEC (Santorini 2010).

The purpose of this annotation is to create a syntactic base that is a
testing ground for the Treebank Semantics system (http://www.compling.jp/ts).

Once created, annotated data serves as input to the Treebank
Semantics system that outputs (higher-order) predicate logic meaning
representations. Outputs are checked and form part of a cycle for
improving the source annotation and the Treebank Semantics system.

The overall effort is leading to the creation of a corpus with both
parsed data content and corresponding meaning representation content.
